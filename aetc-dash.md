Description:
To gather insights into industry best practices, innovative solutions, and potential approaches to support The Department of the Air Force’s recruiting efforts. This RFI requests information from industry partners regarding their capabilities to provide marketing and advertising services. 

Summary:
It is the Government’s intention to research available sources to meet the above criteria as part of this preliminary Market Research RFI. The Government may use responses to this RFI/SS to determine industry’s capability to perform the services outlined within this RFI; determine the commerciality of this service; the capability for small businesses to perform this service; and any other determination as required by the Government. The main emphasis is to determine industry capability to provide a robust AETC program for the recruitment of future Airmen and Guardians.

Scope:
Historically, the Government has relied upon a prime contractor to function as integrator for all marketing and advertising efforts, but now the Government is poised to perform that role of integrator. This marketing and advertising effort encompasses a comprehensive range of services designed to enhance the AETC's digital presence, audience engagement, and lead generation efforts. This aspect of that mission may include:
1)	Designing a user-friendly, mobile-responsive analytics dashboard with customizable visualizations tailored to AETC and USAF/USSF stakeholder needs. Additionally, developing dashboards to display key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversion rates, campaign ROI, website traffic, and tactical performance. The dashboards should be filterable across multiple parameters, including enterprise, service/component, campaign, channel, tactic, and geography. Integration with AETC and USAF/USSF systems, various website analytics and performance report platforms, past and current data, computing conversion metrics, and incorporating brand tracking metrics from various sources will be essential.
2)	Leveraging Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and other statistical techniques to provide predictive analytics, detect trends and anomalies, and enable A/B testing analysis. The dashboard should aggregate data in real-time, ensuring accuracy and timeliness, and will include data cleansing and transformation processes. A secure environment compliant with DoD cybersecurity standards should be provided with robust security measures. 
3)	Delivering real-time data visualizations with interactive features, customizable templates for different user roles, and exportable reports. Comprehensive training materials and sessions should be provided, along with ongoing technical support and regular updates based on user feedback. The contractor will adopt a cloud-native or hybrid architecture for scalability, perform ongoing maintenance, and provide monthly performance reports, quarterly reviews, and annual summaries. Proactive communication and collaboration with AETC, USAF/USSF, and third-party vendors will ensure operational continuity and the integration of emerging technologies to enhance dashboard capabilities. A contingency plan will be developed to maintain 99% system uptime.
